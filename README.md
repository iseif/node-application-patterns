Source Code for Pluralsight's Node Application Patterns Course
===========================================

This is the source code for Tekpub's old Node Application Patterns course, which was migrated to Pluralsight in the fall of 2013. There are some differences in approach to normal Pluralsight courses - this is because I did things a bit differently back then.

If you have any questions or issues, feel free to leave them here.

Installation
